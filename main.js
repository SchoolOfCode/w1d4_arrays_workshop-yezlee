ðŸ‘‰ Declare an index variable and assign it the value of 0.

ðŸ‘‰ In a while loop, console.log the array item at the current index and add 1 to the index variable.

ðŸ‘‰ Have the while loop run until the index is equal to or greater than the array's length property.

## Task 4 - Looping and Accessing

ðŸ‘‰ Refactor task three to use a for loop instead of a while loop.

## Task 5 - Looping and Reassigning

```js
let words = ["ben", "ha", "spla", "fa", "ca", "dra"];
// for loop goes here

console.log(words);
```

ðŸ‘‰ Use a for loop to iterate over the words array and add the letter t to the end of each word.
